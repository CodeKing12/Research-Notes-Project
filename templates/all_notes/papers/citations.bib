  abstract   = {We conducted an experiment providing fertilizer grants to female rice farmers in Mali. We found that women who received fertilizer used both more fertilizer and more complementary inputs such as herbicides and hired labor. This shows that farmers respond to an increase in one input by re-optimizing other inputs. Second, while the increase in inputs led to a considerable increase in output, we found no evidence that profits increased. Our results suggest that fertilizer's impact on profits is small compared to other sources of variation. This may make it difficult for farmers to learn about the returns to fertilizer.},

  abstract   = {Complete and competitive markets imply a separation of the consumption (labor supply) and production (labor demand) decisions of the farm household. This paper tests for separation using the observation that in the absence of labor markets, household composition is an important determinant of farm labor use. The test has power when off-farm employment or hiring constraints, or differing efficiencies of family and hired labor lead to demographic variables affecting farm labor demand. An empirical model is developed to test the proposition that household labor demand (farm employment) is independent of family composition. The model is estimated on a household-farm data set from rural Java. Measurement error and endogeneity issues are addressed with instrumental variables techniques. I cannot reject the null hypothesis that farm labor allocation decisions are independent of household structure. The results are robust to different specifications of the labor demand function.},

  abstract   = {This article explores the application of oblivious equilibrium (OE) to highly concentrated markets. We define a natural extended notion of OE, called partially oblivious equilibrium (POE), that allows for there to be a set of strategically important firms (the ``dominant'' firms), whose firm states are always monitored by every other firm in the market. We perform computational experiments that explore the characteristics of POE, OE, and Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), and find that POE generally performs well in highly concentrated markets. We also derive error bounds for evaluating the performance of POE for cases where MPE cannot be computed.},

The empirical methodology uses the entry decisions of airlines as indicators of underlying profitability; the results extend the empirical literature on airport presence by providing a new set of estimates of the determinants of city pair profitability. The literature on empirical models of oligopoly entry is also extended, particularly via a focus on the important (and difficult) role of differences between firms.},

  abstract   = {We use microdata collected at the border and the store to characterize the price impact of recent US trade policy on importers, exporters, and consumers. At the border, import tariff pass-through is much higher than exchange rate pass-through. Chinese exporters did not lower their dollar prices by much, despite the recent appreciation of the dollar. By contrast, US exporters significantly lowered prices affected by foreign retaliatory tariffs. In US stores, the price impact is more limited, suggesting that retail margins have fallen. Our results imply that, so far, the tariffs' incidence has fallen in large part on US firms. (JEL E31, F13, F14, F31, L11)},
